WE'RE
ENTERING
AN
ERA
WHICH
OUR
ENEMIES
CAN
MAKE
IT
LOOK
LIKE
ANY
ONE
IS
SAYING
ANYTHING
AT
ANY
POINT
IN
TIME
EVEN
IF
THEY
WOULD
NEVER
SAY
THOSE
THINGS
SO
FOR
INSTANCE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
ME
SAY
THINGS
LIKE
I
KNOW
KILIMANJARO
WAS
RIGHT
OR
BEN
CARSON
IS
IN
THE
SUNKEN
PLACE
OR
ABOUT
THIS
SIMPLY
PRESIDENT
TRUMP
IS
A
TOTAL
AND
COMPLETE
DIPSHIT
NOW
YOU
SEE
I
WOULD
NEVER
SAY 
THESE
THINGS
AT
LEAST
NOT
IN
A
PUBLIC
ADDRESS
BUT
SOME
ONE
ELSE
WOULD
SOME
ONE
LIKE
GORDON
PEAL
THIS
IS
A
DANGEROUS
TIME
MOVING
FORWARD
WE
NEED
TO
BE
MORE
VIGILANT
WITH
WHAT
WE
TRUST
FROM
THE
INTERNET
THAT'S
A
TIME
WHEN
WE
NEED
TO
RELY
ON
TRUSTED
NEW
SOURCES
MAY
SOUND
BASIC
BUT
HOW
WE
MOVE
FORWARD
IN
THE
AGE
OF
INFORMATION
IS
GOING
TO
BE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
WHETHER
WE
SURVIVE
OR
WHETHER
WE
BECOME
SOME
KIND
OF
FUCKED
UP
DYSTOPIA
THANK
YOU
STAY
WOKE
BITCHES
